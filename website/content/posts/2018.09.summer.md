+++ The second year of our summer Café Code program has just wrapped up. We ran a weekly ~1 hour discussion group all summer. Some of the highlights:

“Learning that I can (and should) have tech discussions with folks outside computer science”

“Being introduced to new softwares, languages and programs”

“Discussions on ethics of machine learning”

“[Café] code became my place of most comfort. Thank you very much for organizing it.”

“DONUTS!”

Now that we’re starting to figure out how to do this well, we’re going to start making our resources and programs available. If you’re interested in starting a chapter, please reach out. Nick: nrecord@bigelow.org or Kevin: kguay@bigelow.org
